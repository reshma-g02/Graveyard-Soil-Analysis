# Graveyard-Soil-Analysis
This GIS-based study investigates whether graveyards in seacoast New Hampshire are more commonly situated in glaciomarine silt/clay or glacial till. Findings reveal a preference for glaciomarine silt/clay, likely due to its superior drainage and ease of excavation, while also considering how bedrock and natural hazards influence site selection.
